## Definitions

## Creating New Users

### You are required to fill out: last name, alias, email, username, nickname, user license, and profile.
* Usernames must be unique across __all__ Salesforce orgs, even those outside of yours. They must be in email format (ex: markus@gmail.com). However, these do not need to be unique.

[User Licenses](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=users_licenses_overview.htm&type=5)

### Guidelines for adding new users
* Usernames must be unique.
* Format for usernames must be in the form of an email (this does not need to be an working email).
* Email can be the same across an org.
* Passwords must be changed upon the first login.
* Login Link can only be used once. If password is not set after following the link, you have reset password.
* All users have their own record that allows customization, individual settings, privileges, etc.
* Users must have a profile assigned to them. This is what determines what they can access and do. Admins, for example, can access all records and objects and make whatever changes they can. A Read-Only profile may be limited to only certain objects and records and cannot make updates or changes.

### Licenses

* Part of the minimum required information when setting up a new user.
* A temporary password is emailed with instructions to login/reset password.
* Users cannot be deleted.

## Localization

Similar to section 1, localization covers the locale, language, time zone, and currency locale, all of which can be overwritten at the individual level.

Locale - affects date/time formats, name format, address format, and number format.
Language - affects screen text and online help (language).
Time Zone - affects times.
Currency Locale - currency formatting.

## Adding Multiple Users

* Allows for up to 10 users to be added at the same time.
  * If this is used:
    * The username will match each user's email address.
    * Licenses will be the same for all users assigned this way.
    * Users will need to be edited on an individual basis later on.

## Login History

* Useful when trying to figure out login information. You can see when someone logged in last (time), from where (IP address) and what type of application.
* Viewable as a related list.
* Shows __20,000__ records over the past __6 months__.
* Shows API logins; records can be downloaded to CSV or GZIP files.

## Reset Password and Locked Accounts

Passwords can be reset in a variety of ways. A user can do so by clicking the 'Forgot Your Password' link or have n admin can reset from setup (including from the app). Also shown is the number of login attempts.

For locked accounts, an administrator can reset the acct info.

[Unlock Users](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=users_unlock.htm&type=5)

## Delegating Administration

Delegation is possible and allows those users to create/edit users (in certain profiles/roles), reset passwords, assign roles, assign permissions sets, assign users to specific public groups.

## Login As Other Users

Accessible under Login Access and can be done by an admin. This can be done by an admin without needing a password or permissions.

## User Access Issues/Troubleshooting

Login Issues can include:
* Incorrect username.
* Password is case-sensitive.
* Locked out.
* Attempting to login to a sandbox instead or real site.
* Hour/IP restrictions.
* Account is not verified.

## Activating/Deactivating Users

An activation will allow the new user to log into Salesforce. This must be completed prior to attempting to login and is usually accomplished by the automatic email that is generate by Salesforce once a user is created. When created, user records must be activated ("Activated upon creation"). Users can be activated/deactivated at a later time.

Deactivation will prevent them from being able to log back on. They will loose all access to the org including emails and chatter alerts. This is the only option since deleting users is not possible. Self-deactivation is a possibility.

[Considerations for Deactivating Users](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=users_deactivate_considerations.htm&type=5)

## Freezing Users

Freezing users can be helpful when unable to complete deactivation. This goes into efffect instantly and will cut their login access (also without emails and chatter alerts. Their licenses, however, are still attached to them and will not be reusable until they are decttvated.

[Freezing Users](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=users_freeze.htm&type=0)

# Section Review

User setup allows for a wealth of options concerning your users, their access levels, permissions, etc. Not only can you manage passwords and login settings here, you can even adjust individual permissions (such as giving a user access to information above their role in the hierarchy). This is where exceptions will come in.

When creating new users you will be required to include certain pieces of information. Salesforce likes using usernames in the form of emails and since the username will be used to login, this must be unique across the entire Salesforce system. However, because of the email ending, you a huge range of options. And, since this __may__ not be your actual email, or even a working email, you can make something up (given the _@emaildomain.com_). Licenses is also important because it will determine what your user can do; an admin's access will differ from a standard users.
