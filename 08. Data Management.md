## Definitions

## Salesforce Record ID

* Salesforce records have global unique IDs assigned to each.
  * 15 character case sensistive IDs are in the UI.
  * 18 character case insensitive IDs are used by APIs (can be converted by removing the last 3 characters).

## External IDs

* External ID serves as an identifier for a record (from a different system) that is then added to a salesforce object.
  * Has up to 25 custom fields.
  * These must be either text, number, or emails and must be unique.
 
## Mass Transfer Records

* Allows for transfering multiple accounts, leads, and custom objects. 
  * Primarily used withing Salesforce for transfering from one user to another.
  * Requires being account owner or having privelages above the account owner. 
  * Users with Modify All (Data) are also able to transfer any record as needed.

## Mass Transfer Approval Requests

* Used to help located records which are currently awaiting approval. This further allows users/approvers to mass remove/transfer records as desired.

## Mass Deleting Records & Related Data Deleted

* These options allow for mass deleting of records (e.g. accounts, cases, contects, etc.).
  * Note that this will also delete any related data that may also be kept on the record.
  * Deleted recordds will be sent to the recycle bin unless the option is chosen to permanently delete records.
  
## Transferring Individual Records

* Primarly used to transfer individual records between users. Similar to other requirements, user must be owner of the record or be higher in hierarchy. 
* Recipient of transferred record must have read permissions on that object. 
* After the transfer is complete, the recipient will be the new owner of the record and associated information.

## Salesforce Duplicate Management

* Duplicated management allows for implementing rules that help ensure data integrity. 
* Users can limit when and under what conditions duplicates may be created. This is accomplished through logical means (e.g. maching rules that use criteria to compare records). 
* Users are also able to define what happens when duplicates are returned. These can either be rules to allow/block those identified records. 
* Further possibilities include:
  * Reports to identify users/record duplicates.
