## Overview

Process automation is all about making the workload easier for your users. This is accomplished through implementing rules and processes that ultimately can help automate a lot of the time-consuming activities you probably currently work with. This ranges from updating certain fields, executing calculations, completing and sending out emails, etc. Some of those tasks could further consist of:

* Creating alerts prior to a contract ending in order for the user to follow up for additional sales.
* Automatically sending financial information to respective parties within the company.
* Creating alerts in instances where manager approval is required.
* Automatically creating new projects and assigning those projects as needed.
* Create specific child-objects whenever a new account is created.
* Automatic email and chatter alerts whenever certain requirements/rules are met.

## Order of Execution

Order of execution for tasks in Salesforce follow a certain order, as follows:
  1. Actions before a trigger
  2. Validation rule is tested
  3. Duplicate rules are tested
  4. Actions after a trigger
  5. Assignment rules are executed
  6. Auto-response Rules are executed
  7. Workflow rules are executed
  8. Escalation rules are executed
  9. Entitlement rules
  10. Update parents
  11. Save records
  
Automated workflows/processes can be held back from executing if there are rules set which are violated. A admin is able to set when these rule are implemented and tested, so adjusting may need to happen. 

## Workflow Capabilities

The following actions are able to be completed with Workflow automation:
* Create Tasks - created/assigned to particular users.
* Send Emails - can be set to send to one or multiple individuals (up to 5 external email recipients). Use of email templates is an option. 1000/day limit per Salesforce license per org. 2,000,000/day limit org-wide.
* Field Updates - Used to update a value on a record. 
* Outbound Messages - used to send information to an external system (e.g. a database). Data sent via XML and a API messae. This is sent to a web URL endpoint, in a SOAP message. Receiving system must have a web service listening.
* Select Existing Action - ability to work with workflow actions that have already been build. These can be executed as a result of the workflow.
* Immediate Actions - these complete immediately when workflow criteria is met. Order of actions is not guaranteed in the even that there are multiple actions.
* Time-dependent Actions - can be set to execute certain actions at a certain time. This includes the ability to trigger an event days, hours, or specific dates.
* Time Trigger - not avaiable under the following:
  ** Workflow is active (must be deactivated).
  ** Pending action are not complete.
  ** Rule criteria is "Every Time a record is created or edited". 
  
## Lightning Process Builder

The LPB is a process automation feature like the workflow builder. This includes drag-and-drop features to simplify the programming process. However, outbound messages cannot be sent with the process builder. But, for if-then statements, the process builder is recommended. These conditional actions can be set to execute whenever actions happen to a record, can be related to custom or standard objects, etc. Actions can be immediate or scheduled and various needs. 

The basic outline for process building is as follows:
1. Select when the process executes.
2. What object is affected.
3. Select criteria for it to run.
4. Activities that need to be automated.
5. Activate.

The types of actions that can be invoked with the process builder are as follows:
* Apex code execution
* Create a Record
* Email Alerts
* Flows
* Post to Chatter
* Processes
* Quick Actions
* Quip
* Send Custom Notification
* Send Survey Invitation
* Submit for Approval
* Update Records

## Process Builder Considerations

Some considerations include: ensure you don't create an infinite loop (A invokes B which invokes A, etc.) actions are executed in appropriate orders, only supported options are available to users.

## Approval Processes

The Approval Process can easily help automate the decision making process within an organization. This includes addressing who is eligible to approve something, actions that happen when something is approved, and what happens when an action is rejected. 

The Approval Process involves "defining a series of steps to automate the process and approving records". These can be either simple or complex. The overall process consists of the following 3 steps:

1. Create the approval process: this includes identifying the object, setting certain attributes (e.g. entry criteria, approver field, email templates to be sent, page layouts, initial submitters, etc.).
2. Add Approval Steps: there can be multiple approval steps, what happens to records if they meet/dont meet certain criteria, and what happens if a process is rejected/approved.
3. Specify Approval Actions: these include sending email alerts, creating tasks, field updates, or outbound messages.

## Considerations and Responding

Considerations: 

* When a record is submitted to be approved, it is locked until the process completes.
* Audit history is recorded on a seperate related list.

Responding: 

There is a certain process that will usually happen.
* When submitted, a email notification is submitted to the initial approver. 
* If enabled, they can directly reply from email to approve/deny.
* They may respond with: Approve, Approved, Yes, Reject, Rejected, No.
* Comments can be added to email.
* Approve/Reject click-type requests are also available for mobile. 

Use cases for Approval Processes include:
* Management approval of quotes/contracts
* Expense reports
* Approval for funding/purchase
* Work hour authorization
* PTO requests
* Overtime
* Hiring Process
* Deadline Extensions
