# Section Review

This is a small section of the exam totaling between 1-3 questions. If you are setting up a brand new org you will probably spend a good chunk of time here - understandably so. Similar to an About page, you will find company information and settings here (e.g. languages, hours/holiday information, time zones, locales, fiscal year information, Salesforce licenses, etc.).

Your locale is going to contain information and settings that pertain to where you live. The language you speak may depend on where you are located; as does your time zone, currency, and phone numbers (area code). This will be set for the organization, but remember that users can override some of these setting with their personal preferences. Also important to remember is the fact that, depending on your locale, the way information is displayed will change (the number 1000 in the U.S. = 1,000 while in Germany = 1.000).

Not all languages are support, though most major ones are. This is also customizable on the individual level. If a company is located in the U.S. but has a branch in Mexico, it makes sense for those employees to be able to switch their language to Spanish. Time Zones are similarly overridden by the user.

Currencies can be set in a variety of ways, but once multi-currency is enabled, it is permanent. You can set daily conversion rates (and even save them), but they appear to need to be changed manually.

Licenses provide the extra goodies that can make an org more productive - but this does come at a significant price. Remember that you pay not based on how many licenses are actually being used, but based on how many licenses you own (used/unused).

Fiscal Years can get confusing, but remember that they are customizable and you can set your physical year however you want. The standard fiscal year follows the Gregorian calendar (12 months). Custom fiscal years allow for customization. Remember that just like multi-currencies, it cannot be disabled once enabled. However, you can always create a standard (12-month) year using the custom approach.

This section also covers the two types of storage: data and file. Records use data storage and files use file storage (attachments, document, etc.). For example, you can how much storage space you have left. For example:
